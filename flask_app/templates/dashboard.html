                The term 'frame' in fighting games is used to represent the smallest unit of time. One frame is measured 1/60 of a second. Every action in Street Fighter 6 for 
                a character such as walking, jumping, blocking, and attacking can all be measured in frames. In Street Fighter 6, every move in a characters command list has 
                certain attributes associated with them called frame data. This is traditionally broken down to the following attributes
            </p>
            <dl>
                <ul>Startup frames: <span class="text-warning">The beginning portion of the move before it can make contact with your opponent</span></ul>
                <ul>Active frames: <span class="text-warning">The portion where the move is active and can hit your opponent</span></ul>
                <ul>Recovery frames: 
                    <span class="text-warning">
                        The end portion of the move that can no longer make contact with your opponent. During this time you cannot perform any other actions
                    </span>
                </ul>
            </dl>
            <p>
                Frame data gives us detailed information about a characters move set whether a specific move is slow or fast to initiate, if it's safe or unsafe against a blocking 
                opponent, or what kind of effect it has when a move makes contact against your opponent. The properties for a move usually determines if it's more favorable than 
                others as you may see during a match, your opponent can use that move more frequently and more often compared to other moves. By any means it is not neccessary or 
                required to memorize the frame data for all the characters but knowing the moves or buttons that are favorable in the matchup such as if it has a fast startup 
                for example will allow you to act accordingly and know when to strike your opponent thus putting you in an advantagous position in battle
